(This is an adaptation of a similar page on the previous version of this website.)

I have been a professional writer.  By that, I mean I wrote things for other people bcause they paid me to write them.  What I found is that I'm pretty good at it when I get to follow my own inspiration, and I can be great at editing and improving others' work regardless (for the most part) of what I think of the material.  If, on the other hand, you give me a clearly specified non-technical writing task like most copywriters get and I don't believe in the topic or feel inspired by it, I'm really not so good at it.

A couple of examples of the writing work I enjoyed and did well follow:

### Raging Swan - *So What's the Hoard Like, Anyway?*

[Raging Swan](http://ragingswan.com/) is an independent third-party publisher of supplemental materials for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game (which I used to play quite a bit).  Raging Swan's proprietor (Creighton Broadhurst) retained my services as a writer/designer on the development of one of those products, [*So What's the Hoard Like, Anyway?*](http://ragingswan.com/hoard.html), for which I was one of two writer/designers, along with Thomas King.

One of the more prolific and popular RPG product reviewers on the Internet (and one of the more articulate as well), under the name "Endzeitgeit", [reviewed this product](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8rkx/reviews?So-Whats-the-Hoard-Like-Anyway#tabs) at the website for Paizo Publishing, the publisher of Pathfinder RPG, and gave it a full five stars out of five.  In the midst of his listing of quirky and interesting elements of the book's content, I was gratified to see that it looks like every one of the listed elements was something I contributed to the final product, though having read my own copy of the product I see that Thomas King did an excellent job as well.

To be perfectly fair, I must point out that the pickled eggs idea was contributed by the missus.  I find her quite inspirational.

I had a lot of fun with this gig, and would consider doing something like it again, especially given the positive reception it engendered.


### TechRepublic - Regular Contributor

For half a dozen years, I was a TechRepublic contributing writer.  Before the format change from its organization like a tech news site to the newer columnist/blogger format, I contributed occasional articles on a variety of subjects.  After the format change, I spent about half a decade with a commitment for a minimum set number of articles per month.

Some time after CBS acquired TechRepublic's parent company, corporate reorganization came with a redefinition of the requirements contributors must meet to be eligible to write for TechRepublic.  In the summer of 2011, those requirements rendered me ineligible to continue contributing, as I would have had to provide documentation it was not my right to share.  We parted ways at that point, though I remaind an active member of the TechRepublic user community for a while.

Note that the columns following have at times changed names or been reorganized on the site, and may no longer be easily discovered.

#### IT Security Column

For most of my time as a contributor, I was TechRepublic's primary IT Security writer, with a commitment of eight articles per month.  During that time, I built a loyal following and a strong reputation, both of which carried over to my Open Source and Software Development column contributions.

#### Open Source Column

In the last year of my time as a contributor, I took on a commitment of four articles per month for the Open Source column.

#### Software Development Column

In the last year of my time as a contributor, I took on a commitment of two articles per month for the Software Development column.
