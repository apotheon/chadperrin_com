I present my statement of copyright as the creator of these works to inform you that I have the legal power to license my work as presented on this site.  The specific license terms below are intended as legal assurance that you may distribute, modify, relicense, use, abuse, fold, spindle, or mutilate the relevant works at your whim without fear of "intellectual property" legal threat.

Now, we get to the real purpose of this licensing page.

You may accept content under the terms of the DPL or the COIL (license texts below) at your discretion.  Both licenses should be applicable to multiple media types -- text, music (if you for some reason want to make music out of my writing), source code, photos/screenshots, and so on.  Specific details of the comparative utility of each are included after the quoted license texts.

In some respects, both are very similar to other [copyfree licenses][licenselist] but, unlike some of the most popular of those, neither of these is limited in its specific language to software purposes.  Both are also less restrictive in their licensing terms, and more compatible with other licenses, than any Creative Commons license other than CC0.

If you prefer other license terms, please contact me to discuss it.  As long as your desire is not for more restrictive licenses, I'm likely to agree to allow distribution under other terms.  My reason for not including public domain, however, is the lack of legal assurance that people can actually even use the covered works in many jurisdictions.  I want my work to be open to as many people as possible, rather than just unrestricted to some nebulous guesses of who can even legally benefit from a public domain grant.

That aside, I don't really care if you use my work here in a public domain modified, derived, or combined work.  Have at it, with my blessing.  If you are willing to just hope that nobody will get sued for works released under a public domain grant, you should be willing to accept this statement as permission for you to accept these works as though they, too, are public domain.

This license seems to be one of the more widely applicable licenses out there.  It allows distribution of the work without the license text itself included.  It only requires that license terms and legal notices must be made available in one of a variety of ways.  Common license text inclusion requirements can be incredibly awkward for some cases such as performance or distribution of music, video, and image files; this license aims to avoid such issues.

This license is roughly equivalent to the MIT/X11 License (aka Expat License, aka MIT License) or Simplified BSD License (aka 2-Clause BSD License), but with the addition of a patent clause.  It provides the patent clause that is the justification for many projects using the Apache License v2 (AL2), but also avoids the troublesome bookkeeping and project organization clauses of the AL2.
