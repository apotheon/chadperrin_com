This page contains some contact information for me.  It does not yet contain much.

<a href="https://pgp.key-server.io/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xF669FF3E3D35B8A5">verified@chadperrin.com</a> for OpenPGP-capable email

I have one email address I am willing to post on the web in all its spam-attractant, unobfuscated glory, that I actually check with any regularity.  This email address is special because it is set up to automatically send anything that is not digitally signed with an OpenPGP key, or OpenPGP encrypted, directly to the spam pit.  That means (if you want me to actually see any email you send to this address) you will have to use an OpenPGP key to digitally sign your emails to me or encrypt them for my OpenPGP key.  At present, the only actively used OpenPGP key for me is accessible via the email address link above.

<a href="https://web.libera.chat/">Libera Chat IRC</a> for user "apotheon"

For those of you unwilling or unable to use IRC, or use OpenPGP keys with your email client, I plan to eventually add other means of getting in touch with me to this page, but I have (obviously) not done so yet.
