<div class="summary" style="margin-top: 2em;">I'm a software developer looking for Ruby or C programming employment.</div>


## Selected Skills

* **Software Development** (Web, Tooling, Open Source, Library, Application)
* **Programming** (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, C)
* **Process** (TDD/BDD, Refactoring, Pairing, OOP, FP, Agile)

interested in me for above mentioned development and peripheral skills.


## Selected Experience

### tummy.com (Fort Collins, CO and Telecommute)

* Member of Technical Staff (March 2017 to February 2018)

    * web, tooling, and integration software development with **Ruby**,
      **Python**, and Unix **shell**s

    * documentation development, maintenance, and review

    * system and network maintenance, management, and monitoring, using open
      source tools, and operating systems including **CentOS**, **FreeBSD**,
      and **Ubuntu**

    * system specification, deployment, decommissioning

    * backup auditing and management using ZFS and rsync based backup systems
      and custom tools

### Radial Development Group (Loveland, CO and Telecommute)

* Software Developer (April 2015 to October 2016)

    I employed **Ruby on Rails**, **Python and Django**, and **jQuery** and
    **React based JavaScript toolsets** to work in every stage of web
    application development.  **TDD** and **BDD**, pair programming, code
    review, and other agile methodology techniques played important roles in
    much of my work, as well as tools such as **Git** distributed version
    control, continuous integration services, and cloud hosting services.  I
    worked in various company roles, such as project lead developer and
    "SpecDev" operator (filling in where needed to catch projects up on goals).
    I was instrumental in:
    
    * bringing clients from zero to MVP, then to profitability
    * designing and developing reliable, flexible **API**s
    * training new employees and junior developers
    * refactoring and upgrading legacy systems
    * planning project sprints, plus documenting and improving dev process
    * fixing thousands of security issues for client projects
    * accomplishing complex third-party **API integrations**
    * implementing tricky features in very few lines of clear, obvious code
    * designing software architectures, sometimes building them from scratch
      where existing tools were inappropriate to the task or simply inadequate


### Consulting, Nonprofit, and Open Source (Fort Collins, CO)

* Copyfree Initiative Founder/Director (Jun 2007 to Present)

    I have been primary content and software developer, priority manager,
    social janitor, and volunteer wrangler for an unincorporated nonprofit
    association, and performed other tasks at all levels as required.  Developed
    software, mostly web development using **Ruby** and **Sinatra**, as well as
    tooling and library development in **Ruby**.  Employed other technologies
    including **FreeBSD** service jails, **NGINX** reverse proxy, and **Fossil
    SCM** version control.

* FreeBSD Port Maintainer (Oct 2011 to Present)

    I maintained and updated the xsel-conrad port for FreeBSD the ports system.

* Open Source Contributor (2005 to Present)

    I have contributed to a number of projects over the years, from compilers
    to libraries, and started contributing substantial improvements to a BDD
    testing library for C called [**bdd-for-c**][bddc] that I use in my **C**
    projects, such as a todo-queue manager called [**q**][q].

* Ruby Gem Maintainer (Jan 2012 to Present)

    I created and maintain a number of **Ruby gems**, including the following.
    
    * **CharsetMove:** a simple tool for safely changing filenames from Unicode
      to ASCII character sets

    * **Droll:** a dice-rolling simulator library for use in various games,
      including roleplaying games with sophisticated dice-based rule systems,
      plus command line and IRC dicebot front ends
    
    * **FossGit:** a tool for creating and updating mirrors of **Fossil SCM**
      repositories as **Git** repositories and publishing them to **GitHub**
    
    * **RedRug:** a simplified Markdown parser and renderer library front end
      for **RedCarpet**, with both sanitized and unsanitized API methods, and a
      command line utility front end

    * **Versionize:** a very simple software version number handling library

* Snowdrift.coop Steering Committee Member (Feb 2014 to Present)

    project roadmap advisor for co-operative nonprofit corporation


### TechRepublic Contributor (Telecommute)

I contributed articles on a regular schedule covering matters of both principle
and practical utility, on technical subjects.  I maintained community
engagement, minimized staff copy editing, and thoroughly tested solutions
against real-world conditions.  This ultimately culminated in a corpus of
hundreds of articles, on a fourteen articles per month schedule, that exceeded
expectations for depth of analysis.

* Host/Lead Contributor, **IT Security** (Aug 2007 to Jul 2011)

* Regular Contributor, **Linux and Open Source** (Sep 2010 to Jul 2011)

* Regular Contributor, **Programming and Development** (Sep 2010 to Jul 2011)

* Contributing Writer, General Articles (Dec 2005 to Aug 2007)


### Wikimedia Foundation (St. Petersburg and Tampa, FL)

* Datacenter Technician and System Administrator (Jan 2005 to Aug 2005)

    I was the first paid employee of the Wikimedia Foundation and sole on-site
    admin and technician for a network of 20-30 servers with a distributed,
    remote team of volunteer sysadmins.  I installed, configured, and supported
    hardware and software, in a network including **Fedora**, **Debian**,
    **FreeBSD**, **OpenBSD**, and **SuSE** systems.
