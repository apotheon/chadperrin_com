# chadperrin.com

This is my Zola-based rewrite of the chadperrin.com site.

To view work in progress in a browser:

    $ zola serve                # load localhost:1111

I typically ensure rebuild of a deployable version after viewing locally in a
browser by using this:

    $ zola serve; zola build    # load localhost:1111
